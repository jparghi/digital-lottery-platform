That’s the *right* long-term goal — building a true MVP that can grow into a full digital-lottery platform.
But to get there safely and make sure everything actually runs on your machine, we need to **stage** the build rather than try to deliver the entire ecosystem at once in one zip.

Here’s the **architect-level roadmap** I’d propose:

---

## 🧱 1️⃣ MVP Scope (Phase 1 – the part we can build and run end-to-end now)

**Goal:** runnable on your laptop with Docker Compose → demo a complete lottery-purchase flow.

| Component          | Tech                 | Role                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️ Frontend       | React + Vite         | simple page: “Buy Ticket” → calls API |
| 🌐 API Gateway     | Nginx reverse-proxy  | routes `/api/ticket` → Ticket Service |
| 🎫 Ticket Service  | Spring Boot (Java)   | issues ticket, sends event to queue   |
| 💳 Payment Service | Node.js + Express    | consumes message, simulates payment   |
| 🧩 Broker          | Kafka + Zookeeper    | async messaging                       |
| 🗃️ Database       | PostgreSQL           | stores ticket & payment status        |
| 📈 Monitoring      | Prometheus + Grafana | service metrics dashboard             |

Everything wired together in `docker-compose.yml`.
After `docker compose up`, you can:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/ticket/buy
```

and see `Payment confirmed` in logs.

---

## ☁️ 2️⃣ Phase 2 – Cloud Enablement

Once MVP is stable:

| Target                                | Tooling                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes (local minikube → AWS EKS) | Helm charts for each microservice                                |
| Infrastructure-as-Code                | Terraform modules → ECR repos, RDS Postgres, MSK Kafka           |
| CI/CD                                 | GitHub Actions pipeline → build, scan (SonarQube), deploy to EKS |
| Observability                         | OpenTelemetry → CloudWatch / Grafana Loki                        |
| Secrets & Config                      | Vault / AWS Secrets Manager                                      |

## 🧭 3️⃣ Extensible Architecture Blueprint

To stay “smart enough to add more components”:

```
/pollard-iwin/
 ├── frontend/
 ├── gateway/
 ├── services/
 │     ├── ticket-service/
 │     ├── payment-service/
 │     └── user-service/        # (future)
 ├── messaging/
 ├── infra/
 │     ├── docker/
 │     ├── helm/
 │     └── terraform/
 └── docs/
        architecture.md
```

Each service:

* has its own Dockerfile, Helm chart, Terraform module.
* publishes/consumes Kafka events.
* exposes health/liveness endpoints for Kubernetes probes.

---

## 🔐 4️⃣  Next Step (what I can actually build & give you now)

I can safely generate a **complete, runnable Phase 1 MVP ZIP** that includes:

* all source folders above
* Docker Compose file bringing up Kafka + Postgres + services + Grafana
* README with “run locally → see result → extend to cloud” instructions
* placeholder Helm & Terraform directories (empty templates) for future expansion

That ZIP will:

* run fully offline,
* build via `mvn package` and `npm start`,
* demonstrate the architecture loop,
* serve as foundation for later phases.

---

If you confirm 👍, I’ll start generating the **Phase 1 Pollard iWin Digital Lottery MVP ZIP** right away (it’ll take a few minutes to assemble).
Do you want me to go ahead and create that runnable MVP package now?
